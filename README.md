How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  Ensuring that my code, program, and/or software is functional and secure is a multistep process involving efficient collaboration with parts of the team and sufficient testing to ensure that the product is performing as it should. Functionality starts with planning and understanding the needs of the customer and the requirements set forth for the project. Once it it deemed what functionality is required the next steps include building the project and validating that its functionality exists with unit testing. This unit testing should be designed to prove the functionality of the product but should also prove to provide security as well. 
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  Interpreting user needs should be done with a top down approach where  the needs of the user are identified while creating a plan and structure for functionality and requirements. Once the user needs are identified, incorporating them is a multistep process that starts with building some chunk of code and then testing it against possible failures. This needs to continue until all user needs are met and the unit tests themselves prove to test an acceptable percentage of coverage.

How do I approach designing software?
  I approach designing software in a careful and methodical approach. I study the requirements and break it down into the parts that I understand. I then code those basic parts to start to sculpt something that will resemble some sort of structure. Once I have a general structure built I start to fine tune each chunk and test it to make sure that it functions like intended. By the end, I should have several chunks of code that have all been tested thoroughly and that when put together, they work to accomplish the task at hand.
